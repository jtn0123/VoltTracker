# Test markers for selective test execution
# Usage examples:
#   pytest -m "unit"              # Run only unit tests
#   pytest -m "not slow"          # Run all tests except slow ones
#   pytest -m "api and not slow"  # Run fast API tests only
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
    integration: marks tests as integration tests requiring external services
    unit: marks tests as unit tests (fast, isolated)
    api: marks tests that test API endpoints
    database: marks tests that interact with the database
    external: marks tests that make external API calls (weather, elevation)
